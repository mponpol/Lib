### Preface

This book covers the JavaScript language and the JavaScript APIs implemented by web browsers and by Node. I wrote it for readers with some prior programming experience who want to learn JavaScript and also for programmers who already use JavaScript but want to take their understanding to a new level and really master the language. My goal with this book is to document the JavaScript language comprehen‐ sively and definitively and to provide an in-depth introduction to the most important client-side and server-side APIs available to JavaScript programs. As a result, this is a long and detailed book. My hope, however, is that it will reward careful study and that the time you spend reading it will be easily recouped in the form of higher pro‐ gramming productivity.
Previous editions of this book included a comprehensive reference section. I no longer feel that it makes sense to include that material in printed form when it is so quick and easy to find up-to-date reference material online. If you need to look up anything related to core or client-side JavaScript, I recommend you visit the MDN website. And for server-side Node APIs, I recommend you go directly to the source and consult the Node.js reference documentation.

Conventions Used in This Book
I use the following typographical conventions in this book:
Italic
Is used for emphasis and to indicate the first use of a term. Italic is also used for email addresses, URLs, and file names.
Constant width
Is used in all JavaScript code and CSS and HTML listings, and generally for anything that you would type literally when programming.

Constant width italic
Is occasionally used when explaining JavaScript syntax.
Constant width bold
Shows commands or other text that should be typed literally by the user

This element signifies a general note.

This element indicates a warning or caution.

Example Code
Supplemental material (code examples, exercises, etc.) for this book is available for download at:

This book is here to help you get your job done. In general, if example code is offered with this book, you may use it in your programs and documentation. You do not need to contact us for permission unless you’re reproducing a significant portion of the code. For example, writing a program that uses several chunks of code from this book does not require permission. Selling or distributing examples from O’Reilly books does require permission. Answering a question by citing this book and quoting example code does not require permission. Incorporating a significant amount of example code from this book into your product’s documentation does require permission.
We appreciate, but generally do not require, attribution. An attribution usually includes the title, author, publisher, and ISBN. For example: “JavaScript: The Defini‐ tive Guide, Seventh Edition, by David Flanagan (O’Reilly). Copyright 2020 David Fla‐ nagan, 978-1-491-95202-3.”
